# Anonymized Technical Assessment Collection 

After giving it some thought, I decided to share my solutions for some technical assessments
I got to work on while [searching for a job](https://charlietrip.neocities.org/blog/240703-job-search).

*Why?*

Well, I spend quite some time and energy on them and since these efforts were not enough
to land a job, at least they might be useful as a portfolio for future applications
or spawn some interaction with curious readers!

Some rules:

1. The companies are *anonymized*
	meaning that some content might be (slightly) modified to fit this common-decency rule.
2. The assessments are *published as they are*
	because I already spent time on them.
3. I will provide *my opinion on the tasks*
	to promote some discussion/reflection with a grade.

### Structure of the Repo 

* `companyNN`: contains the files of the assessment for company NN

### Grading Explanation

The grades are a number between `0/100` and `100/100`.

*The minimal threshold for decency?*

Depends, so you will have to read!
