# Company 02

**tl;dr:** prepare a presentation on
	[HyperNova](https://eprint.iacr.org/archive/2023/573/20230804:213731), then Q&A.



## Company's Feedback

Quite positive feedback, they liked the presentation and the discussion.



## Opinion and Grade

The task is exactly what I like: a hard paper to read with (basically) 70% of the content/background
	that I had to learn, a key concept to digest and later explain.
I enjoyed the discussion which was quite similar to a PhD defence.

The chosen paper is a good read with really minor typos or confusing points.
It is not a case that it got accepted in Crypto 2024.


**Grade**: `90/100`, good challenge and good paper!
